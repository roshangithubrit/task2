Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

This project aims to address the critical issue of credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. We employed four different algorithms - Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression - to predict and detect fraudulent credit card transactions. After rigorous testing and evaluation, the Random Forest algorithm emerged as the most accurate model with the highest prediction accuracy. Random Forest's ability to handle complex relationships within the data, coupled with its ensemble learning approach, resulted in robust predictions. This GitHub repository contains the code, dataset, and documentation for our credit card fraud detection project. Feel free to explore the implementations and contribute to further improvements. Together, we can enhance the security of financial transactions and protect users from potential fraud. #CodSoft
